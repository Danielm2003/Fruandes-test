A farmer for all his life, he decided to switch to organic production because he found in Fruandes an alternative to the conventional market which is also healthier and feasible. His son Albeiro is also a member and the leader of the association.</p>

                        The association of small-scale organic goldenberry producers was originally formed in 2005 by five women and one man in search of better alternatives for the farmers in the region.

Biofruit was approached by Fruandes in 2007 and the company supported them in reaching organic certification in 2009.

            Growing on large bushes, the goldenberry is protected by a decorative, lantern-type shell. The hand picking is labourous, and harvesting happens year round. The fruit is fragile and needs to be carefully packaged so it doesn't get damaged on the long trip to Ibagué.
            <br><br>
            Once the goldenberries reach our facility, they undergo a washing and disinfection phase. They are then dehydrated and sent on their way. Up to 100 fresh goldenberries are needed for 100g of dried product.
